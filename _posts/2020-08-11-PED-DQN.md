## Abstract  
This paper proposed a **deep reinforcement learning** algorithm for **semi-cooperative** multi-agent tasks.  
*Here, the word "semi-cooperative" means agents are equipped with their separate reward functions, yet with some willingness to cooperate.*  
The algorithm in the paper is called Peer Evaluation-based Dual DQN (PED-DQN), it proposes to give *peer evaluation signals* to observed agents.  
*Here, "peer evaluation signals" quantify how agents strategically value a certain transition and this could be regarded as agents' 'selfish'.*
